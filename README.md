## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Security and Data Protection
1. **Data Encryption**: 
   - All customer data should be encrypted both at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
2. **Compliance**: 
   - The platform must comply with **GDPR**, **CCPA**, and other relevant data protection regulations.
   - **Audit Logs**: Keep logs of data access and actions for compliance and security auditing.

### 5.4 Deployment

The **Probe AI** platform is available in two deployment options: **SaaS (Software as a Service)** and **Custom Deployment**. Both deployment models cater to different customer needs based on their requirements for data handling, security, and cost considerations.

#### 5.4.1 SaaS Deployment
- **Description**: The SaaS deployment offers a cost-effective solution for businesses that can work within the platform's standard configuration and data integration tools. It is ideal for companies that are comfortable with cloud-based, multi-tenant environments and do not require hosting sensitive or proprietary information locally.
  
- **Cost Efficiency**: The SaaS model provides significant cost savings, as it is based on a subscription pricing model. Pricing varies based on the choice of tools, integration requirements, and the volume of data processed. It allows businesses to scale seamlessly without heavy upfront investments in infrastructure.
  
- **Features**:
  - **Multi-Tenant Cloud Environment**: Hosted on secure cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), providing high availability and auto-scaling.
  - **Pre-configured Integrations**: A range of ready-to-use integrations for various data sources and third-party services (e.g., LinkedIn, financial data sources).
  - **Data Security**: All data transmitted and stored on the cloud platform is encrypted using SSL/TLS and AES-256 encryption.
  - **No Maintenance**: The SaaS version is fully managed, ensuring automatic updates, security patches, and system health monitoring.

#### 5.4.2 Custom Deployment
- **Description**: The custom deployment option is designed for customers with more specific requirements, particularly for those needing to handle non-public or highly sensitive data. This option offers the flexibility of an on-premise or private cloud-based deployment, ensuring that data remains within the customer's control.

- **Use Case**: Custom deployment is the only option available for clients requiring complete control over their data due to regulatory, privacy, or operational needs. It also provides a tailored infrastructure for organizations with specialized integration requirements or for those who need to adhere to strict internal policies regarding data handling and security.
  
- **Features**:
  - **Private Hosting**: The solution can be deployed on the clientâ€™s private cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise infrastructure, giving customers full control over their data storage and processing.
  - **Tailored Configurations**: Custom tools, integrations, and specific security protocols can be implemented to meet unique client needs.
  - **Higher Security**: With full control over the deployment environment, the client can enforce stricter access control, data isolation, and monitoring policies.
  - **Compliance**: Suitable for organizations that need to comply with regional data protection regulations or industry-specific standards (e.g., HIPAA, PCI DSS).

- **Costs**: Custom deployment typically involves higher upfront costs due to infrastructure setup, additional customization, and maintenance. Ongoing operational costs depend on the scale and the complexity of the deployment, but it provides complete flexibility and data sovereignty.

#### 5.4.3 Decision Criteria
- **Choose SaaS**: If you require a cost-effective solution with minimal infrastructure overhead and can work within the platformâ€™s standardized configuration and tools.
- **Choose Custom Deployment**: If your organization has specific security, compliance, or integration requirements, or if you handle sensitive, proprietary, or non-public data.
Both deployment options will ensure that the **Probe AI** platform delivers value according to your needs, with SaaS offering scalability and cost savings, and custom deployments providing full control and enhanced security.
